This directory contains scripts that are all called each time
the device attempts to suspend. These scripts determine the
amount of minutes the device is allowed to sleep for.

They must echo a single number, the number of minutes the device
must sleep for, or not echo anything. Whichever number is the 
lowest will be used.
