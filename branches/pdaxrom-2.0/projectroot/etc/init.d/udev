# This needs to be run at the earliest possible point in the boot
# process. But it could be a good idea to run the syslogd first, due
# to udev uses it for logging (if enabled).
#
# Based on the udev init.d script
#
# Thanks go out to the Gentoo developers for proving
# that this is possible to do.
#
# Yes, it's very verbose, feel free to turn off all of the echo calls,
# they were there to make me feel better that everything was working
# properly during development...
