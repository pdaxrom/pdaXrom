Subject: fix the softlockup watchdog to actually do something
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

this Xen related commit:

   commit 966812dc98e6a7fcdf759cbfa0efab77500a8868
   Author: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>

       Ignore stolen time in the softlockup watchdog

broke the softlockup watchdog to never report any lockups. (!)

print_timestamp defaults to 0, this makes the following condition
always true:

	if (print_timestamp < (touch_timestamp + 1) ||

and we'll in essence never report soft lockups.

apparently the functionality of the soft lockup watchdog was never
actually tested with that patch applied ...

[this is -stable material too.]
