    Bug 30332 â€” udisks does not tear down LUKS devices when the slave is forcibly removed
    
    In the event of the forced removal of a crypto device, use the luks_holder
    property since it is still available to figure out which underlying cleartext
    LUKS device to teardown, instead of scanning through all available devices
    (because the cleartext device already has had its properties cleaned up).
